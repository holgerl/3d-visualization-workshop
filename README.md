# 3D visualization workshop

This is a half-day (3 hours) workshop on 3D visualization with webgl using three.js.

## Part 1:

In this part we familiarize ourselves with the three.js API by creating some simple objects and hooking them up with input from the microphone.

Intro material:

- [About 3d visualization](https://holgerl.github.io/3d-visualization-workshop/slides/about-3d-visualization.html)
- [About three.js](https://holgerl.github.io/3d-visualization-workshop/slides/about-threejs.html)

Tasks:

- [Task 1 - Hello cube world!](https://github.com/holgerl/3d-visualization-workshop/tree/master/tasks/task1.md)
- [Task 2 - Animation and sensory input](https://github.com/holgerl/3d-visualization-workshop/tree/master/tasks/task2.md)


## Part 2:

In this part we will look at shaders, what their role are and what they can do. We also look at how we can use shaders in three.js.

Intro material:

- [About shaders](https://holgerl.github.io/3d-visualization-workshop/slides/about-shaders.html)

Tasks:

- [Task 3 - Fragment shaders](https://github.com/holgerl/3d-visualization-workshop/tree/master/tasks/task3.md)
